STEM has always interested me due to my hobbies of gaming and things like that, which most often involved coding in them to help them run well and smoothly. Both playing video games and drawing need to be my two passions in life, as it’s something I do practically on an hourly basis. </p><a href="http://imgur.com/9C17Gos"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9C17Gos.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><p>Hi, my name is Alia Masud. I just graduated from Morris Plains Borough School and I’m going to Morristown High School this fall. I’ve always loved STEM because I love creating things, and that’s what STEM means to me. I’m going to be in STEM at MHS this fall, and I have recently gotten an interest in computer science. I hope that one day I will be able to use computer science to make something amazing, that will impact the people who need help the most.</p></center></h1>

  <p><h3>People and Animal Extinction</h3>
  <h4>Pollution</h4> 
  <p1>Air, water, and noise pollution are all extremely harmful to animals. Each type, contaminate animals' natural habitats and make it excessively hard to live. The increase in air pollution from factories, burning coal, etc. exceedingly make the air difficult for the animals to breathe in. Water pollution tints and contaminates the water, which can bring on a string of dangerous diseases for land and marine animals. Noise pollution from honking horns and drilling are very harmful to marine animals who use noise to communicate, hunt, discover, etc. They get confused by all the different noises that surround them.</p1>

  <h4>Hunting</h4>
  <p1>Since the beginning, humans have hunted animals to use for our own benefit.  However, doing so has caused animals to go extinct; the passenger pigeon was hunted to extinction last century.  Additionally, the american bison and numerous species of whales have been hunted close to extinction.   Swordfish, cod, and tuna have all seen declines in population as the fish industry expands, and those aren’t the only species to have suffered as a result of over hunting.  Over hunting has caused declines in population  for many different species, resulting in them becoming endangered or even extinct.</p1>

  <h4>Global Warming</h4>
  <p1>Global warming is an issue that can affect all animals. The most common cause for global warming are the exertion of greenhouse gases. With an increase in technology and factory work over the past couple of decades, the atmosphere has become warmer. Which is extremely dangerous to animals. One example is with fish and polar bears. Because of climate change, fish migrate to colder seas. But with a lack of fish, polar bears grow hungry and become thinner. Polar bears are known for their husky nature, and heavy bodies. For a polar bear to become thinner means it is becoming unhealthy, causing it to become sick.</p1>
